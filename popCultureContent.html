						<h3 class="EraTopic">The origins of pop music</h3>
						<p>Pop music was originated in the United States and the United Kingdom.
						The genre began as a mash-up of different popular music styles in the early 1950s. 
						<br>
						Jazz, country, bebop, rap, and rock 'n' roll were among the musical styles that influenced the development of pop.
						<br><br>
						Sheet music was prominent in the pop genre, where musical sheets were issued as instructional aids for playing an instrument. 
						The publishing industry was founded to address the need for sheet music.
						They were hunting for popular performers and printed their music for sale so that other musicians may perform it.
						When the phonograph was developed in the early 1900s, this evolved to listening to recorded performances, which sparked physical sales of music.
						Pianos found their way into the phonograph around the beginning of the twentieth century, resulting in new interpretations of pop music.

						<h3 class="EraTopic">1920s – 1940s : the birth of Jazz, Blues and R & B </h3>
						<p>Jazz defined the first important era in our pop music history timeline. Up until the 1920s, 
						the western populace had loved classical music, church hymns, and ballads, so jazz brought something fresh to the scene while surprising audiences.
						Its unquestionable influence has influenced subsequent genres such as blues, R&B, and hip hop. 
						Blues emerged from jazz, creating the groundwork for rock'n'roll.

						<h3 class="EraTopic">1950s – 1960s : Rock ’n’ Roll takes over</h3>
						<p>In the 1950s, pop musicians started to take influences from jazz and blues and the unique blend of genres birthed one of the most important revolutions in pop music history.
                        This was due to labels such as Columbia Records, who combined the music genres of this time to produce pop music.
						<br><br>
						Pioneers such as Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Bill Haley, The Who, and Led Zeppelin took pop music to an entirely new level,
						and the portable radio made it easier for young stars to diversify pop music. 
						<br>
						Elvis Presley was the first artist to create pop music, combining blues, rock 'n' roll, and country music.
						He is referred as <i>"King of Rock and Roll"</i>.
						<br>
						During this time, the British Invasion and Beatlemania movements took over the American pop music charts, 
						leading to the growth of subgenres such as Baroque pop and Bubblegum pop

						<p>The mid-1960s saw the emergence of funk music, which was associated with protest movements and drew influences from genres such as soul, jazz, and R&B.
						Pop rock artists like Elton John and Queen defined the 1970s music scene, and with the advancement of music technology and digital recordings, new genres such as disco, electro, techno, and house emerged. 
						<br><br>
						Rock music took on a new form with glam rock, hair metal, and stadium rock, featuring artists such as KISS, Bon Jovi, and Bruce Springsteen. 
						<br><br>
						In the 1980s, digital equipment was heavily used in pop music, and artists like Michael Jackson and Prince defined the genres of the time.

						<h3 class="EraTopic">1990 – 2000s : Hip Hop, Pop and Grunge</h3>
						<p>Hip Hop marked a significant revolution in pop music comparable to rock'n'roll and digital instruments.
						Initially, mainstream companies and record labels were hesitant to accept rap and hip hop into the music scene, but once the wider public caught on, the genre became a permanent fixture. 
						This musical revolution reduced the emphasis on harmony and increased the importance of rhythm and speech.
						<br><br> 
						Other genres, such as grunge, punk, and pop, experienced significant changes in the 1990s, paving the way for early 2000s pop music.
						<br>
						The early 2000s pop genre emerged as a fusion of various sounds and subgenres, influenced by R&B and hip-hop artists.
						It was defined by musicians such as Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, and Ms. Jackson. 
						<br>
						Pop bands like Spice Girls and S Club 7 and Backstreet Boys became a sensation among teen audiences, defining the trend of boy bands and girl bands.
						Britney Spears is referred as the <i>"Princess of Pop"</i> as she is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

						<h3 class="EraTopic">Popular music today</h3>
						<p>Because of technological innovation and the ingenuity of performers, popular music is constantly evolving, 
							drawing inspirations from many other genres and putting their own stamp on them. Hip hop, r&b, and soul dominated the charts in the second decade of the 2000s,
							and there are still many artists adapting this genre now. 
							<br>
							Today is the ideal time in history to discover many various artists and genres, as more people have access to unlimited libraries of music and can find musicians who fit outside of the constraints of pop music.
